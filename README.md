In the second CA, the chosen databases are Cassandra and MongoDB. In the repository will contain two jupyter notebook files. One will be used to import and manipulate the dataset from Cassandra and the second will apply the same but the dataset imported from MongDB.
The processing stages will be handled in PySpark, and separating into two notebooks will give the same amount of memory to each database, but also to ensure a fair comparison between the two. The dataset has 1.6 millions tweets which it is believed to have a high computational cost.
